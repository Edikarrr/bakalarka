\chapter*{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}

The aim of this bachelor project was to design an information system for support of forensic audit. 
This bachelor project describes the whole process of forensic audit and analyses the software used in the 
process and methods of the audit that could be supported by a new application. A method of this kind 
was found and an information system designed. One part of the design is an analysis that describes 
possible approaches of the design and the consequences of the decisions for each one of them. The choice 
of the final design was reasoned and properly described. The discussion of the technologies to be used 
for the implementation is provided. There is minimum of questions left do answer for 
implementing this application. 


%\section*{Accomplishment} 

It can be said the main aim has been accomplished. The application supporting 
the one part of the process of forensic audit is designed. All main decisions for the functioning of 
the application has been made and a good background for implementation of the application is provided. 
After the implementation and testing the application will be prepared to be used in practice. 



%\section*{Further improvement}
%Follow-up work would definitely include the implementation of the designed application, testing and hands-on experience with real-data.
%Mainly real-world use will show deficiencies, if any, and provide necessary insight for modifications and extensions.
